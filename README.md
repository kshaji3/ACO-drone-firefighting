# ACO-drone-firefighting
AP Research Project:
Designing path planning for fire fighting drone swarm resource allocation. I treat this as a 2D Capacitated Routing Vehicle Problem (CVRP).
All the simulation is done using MATLAB, data pre-processing is done in R (due to ease of manipulating data frames)
The data used is Washington DNR Data from 2019-2020, and simulation is done by randomly selecting 10 samples of fire data separated by region.
