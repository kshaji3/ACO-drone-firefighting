Source code for the following paper, by Karthik Shaji, Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Aerospace Engineering

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511430.3511462

Code Contains (in either current or past commits):

-3D TSP Solvers using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)

-Rudimentary Greedy Optimization Capacitated Vehicle Routing (CVRP) Solver

-ACO CVRP Solver for fire intensities and known locations

-Fire datasheets from WA DNR, R data pre-processing code to clean data for ACO


In-Progress:

-Adding GA CVRP Solver for fire datasets

-Working on obtaining additional natural disaster data for further CVRP Solver testing
